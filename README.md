## Usage Guide

### Adding a Method
1. Click the "+" button at the top right or press `Alt+N`.
2. Enter a method name, optional tags (comma-separated and you can set it only when you create new methods and can't edit next time), description, and command.
3. Click the checkmark (âœ”) to save.
4. **Note:** After saving a new method, the browser will automatically refresh. This ensures all features (like drag-and-drop, search, and tag filters) are fully re-initialized and bug-free for the new method. This refresh is intentional to maintain a stable and consistent user experience.

### Editing a Method
1. Click the pencil (âœŽ) icon next to a method.
2. Edit the title, descriptions, or commands.
3. **To delete:** Double-click the pen icon to reveal the trash icon, then click the trash icon. The delete icon will disappear if you click outside the method.
4. Click the checkmark (âœ”) to save changes.

### Deleting a Method
- When the delete icon is visible (after double-clicking the pen icon), click it to delete the method.
- Choose "Yes" for permanent deletion or "Temporary" to move to Recently Deleted.

### Adding Description/Command Pairs
- While editing a method, click the "+" button inside the method to add more pairs.

### Reordering
- Drag the method header to reorder methods.
- Drag description/command pairs within a method.

### Undo & Redo (**NEW**)
- Press `Ctrl+Z` to undo your last change, or `Ctrl+Y` to redo.
- Undo/redo works for all actions, including backup restore/merge, add, edit, delete, and drag-and-drop.
- **Note:** Undo/redo history is cleared when you close or reload the browser tab.

### Search & Filter
- Click the search icon or press `Ctrl+F` to search.
- Use the dropdown to filter by method, text, or command.
- Use the tag filter to show only methods with a specific tag.

### Backup & Restore
- Click "Backup" in the footer to download your data.
- Click "Restore" to import a backup (replace or merge).
  - A sample file called "bonus-backup.json" is included with this project. It contains extra ready-made methodologies and commands to help you get started or expand your collection.
  - To use the bonus backup or any backup file:
    1. Click the "Restore" button (ðŸ“‚) in the footer.
    2. Click "Choose Backup File" and select "bonus-backup.json" (or any other backup file).
    3. You will see a preview of the backup contents.
    4. Choose one of the following options:
       - **Replace:** This will completely overwrite your current methods with the methods from the backup file. Use this if you want to start fresh or restore a previous state.
       - **Merge:** This will add any new methods from the backup file to your current list, without removing your existing methods. If a method with the same name exists, only new commands or tags will be added. Use this to combine your data with the bonus backup or another backup file.
    5. Confirm your choice. Your methods will be updated accordingly.


### Recently Deleted
- Click "Recently Deleted" in the footer to view, restore, or permanently delete items.

### Theme
- Click the theme button at the bottom to cycle through Light, Dark, and Solarized themes.

## Tips & Warnings

- **Tips:**
  - Regularly use the Backup feature to save your data externally, especially before clearing browser data or switching devices.
  - Use tags to organize and quickly filter your methodologies.
  - Use the search and tag filter to quickly find specific methods or commands.
  - Make use of keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow.
  - Use undo/redo (`Ctrl+Z`/`Ctrl+Y`) to quickly recover from mistakes during editing, deleting, or restoring/merging backups.

- **Warnings:**
  - **Do NOT clear your browserâ€™s local storage unless you have backed up your data.** All methods and commands will be lost.
  - **Do NOT use this tool for storing sensitive credentials or secrets.** While data is local, browsers are not designed for high-security storage.
  - **Do NOT open the file in multiple tabs and edit simultaneously.** This may cause data loss or overwrite issues.
  - **Do NOT rely solely on browser storage for long-term retention.** Always keep external backups.
  - **Do NOT share your backup file with others unless you are sure it contains no sensitive information.**
  - **Undo/redo history is lost when you close or reload the browser tab.**
