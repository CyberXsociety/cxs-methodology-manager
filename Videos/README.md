### ⚠️ **Note About Video Quality**


Hey everyone!

Unfortunately, GitHub does not allow files larger than **25 MB**, so I had to compress the demo video to **720p** to fit the limit.

Also, due to my screen recorder, some actions like **searching methods** or **restoring backups** may not be fully visible in the video. The tool works perfectly it is just a recording issue. I will try using a better recorder next time.


For now, you can still check out the **high-quality images here** for a clearer view:

Thanks for understanding! 🙌
