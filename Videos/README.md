### ⚠️ **Note About Video Quality**


Hey everyone!

Unfortunately, GitHub does not allow files larger than **25 MB**, so I had to compress the demo video to **720p** to fit the limit.

Also, due to my screen recorder, some actions like **searching methods**, **filters** or **restoring backups** may not be fully visible in the video. The tool works perfectly it is just a recording issue. I will try using a better recorder next time.

and as you seen when i restore method from recently deleted so tag is not visible that is solved now so everything working perfect if you any issue just contact us from official website


For now, you can still check out the **high-quality images here** for a clearer view:

Thanks for understanding! 🙌
